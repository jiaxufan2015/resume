# resume
This is the resume of Jiaxu Fan. 
I have a master degree in chemical engineering at Northwestern University. But the thing is, I don't love chemicals. I love playing with data and learning new stuff on a daily basis. So I started teaching myself to be a data scientist since Feb. 2017. Now I'm seeking job opportunities in data science. My email: nujiaxu@gmail.com My phone: 2247149760
